Business Problem
Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small
business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing
high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and
our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey
for our passengers.However, we are currently facing challenges due to
several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight
taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market
resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is
under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle
this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to
find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the
average profit earned per seat.


1. Stricter environmental regulations: The demand on the airlines industry
to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more
stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict
expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes: To solve environmental issues and increase money,
governments all around the world are taxiing aircraft more heavily, which
raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The lack of
trained people in the aviation sector has increased labor costs and
increased turnover rates.
